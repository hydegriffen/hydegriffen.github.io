        <h2 class="mb-5">Highlights</h2>
        <h3>Upbringing</h3>
        <p>Growing up along the beautiful Jersey Shore, I have always had many interests. During my time attending a STEM high school, I competed in robotics, acted in musicals, and earned my Eagle Scout award. While at Stevens Institute of Technology pursuing my Computer Engineering degree, I led the Game Development Club, served on the student senate, sang in the President's Ensemble choir, and traveled to perform comedy. After graduating, I accepted a temporary position at Wiley as a testing analyst.</p>
        <h3>Omni-Channel Chat & CTI</h3>
        <p>Shortly thereafter, Wiley offered me a permanent role. Following an unsuccessful attempt by our technology team to build a custom push chat system, I researched Salesforce's Omni-Channel feature and worked with operations stakeholders to define a new business requirement for the chat implementation. The success of the chat delivery naturally set me up as the analyst to support the subsequent Cloud Telephony Integration between Five9 and Salesforce Omni-Channel. After playing a critical role in the project and travelling to Belize to oversee the off-sight launch, I was promoted to a lead position on the newly-formed Solutions team.</p>
        <h3>Service Cloud Relaunch, Lightning Migration, & Support Communities</h3>
        <p>With this new role, I focused on accelerating our Service Cloud maturity as the Product Owner for the CRM Service team. As we adopted the agile framework, we spent several months rebuilding our processes using “out of box” components to minimize technical debt. Once we established strong foundations, we proceeded to launch 16 new self-service “Help” sites on the Salesforce Communities platform (now called Experience Cloud) as well as migrate nearly 400 internal users to Salesforce Lightning. With a scalable support ecosystem in-place, we leveraged our infrastructure to quickly integrate the company's influx of acquisitions into our core support workflow.</p>
        <h3>Einstein AI & Embedded Support</h3>
        <p>After gratefully accepting a promotion into management, it was time to start exploring more advanced capabilities. We launched and iterated on a chatbot designed to help customers quickly resolve their inquiries. To ensure quality, we implemented measurements that allow us to track performance and drive continuous improvement. We also developed a component that enables personalized and searchable knowledgebase for convenient self-service without the conversational format. In parallel, we deeply validated and deployed AI recommendation tools to aid support agents and allow them to focus on resolving the customer's issue.</p>
        <h3>Dreamforce 2022 & World Tour NYC</h3>
        <p>In September 2022, I had the opportunity to share my AI experience at <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/products/what-is-salesforce/" target="_blank">Salesforce</a>'s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco. Based on multiple co-pilots I have conducted with Salesforce, my primary session focused on my AI journey, validation process, and lessons learned. I also spoke briefly about how I am using conversational AI insights to reduce manual analysis in a session with Salesforce's AI Research team. Following the event in San Francisco, I spoke again at Salesforce World Tour NYC in December covering similar topics. Overall, I had a great experience sharing my story with other passionate service leaders and look forward to future events.

As the former President of the Stevens Game Development Club, I initially groomed my passion for programming through the unique lens of game design and later switched my focus to web development.</p>

        <div class="panel">
          <p><b>Tweetalyze</b> was a set of data analysis and visualization tools developed using the Twitter API. Since Twitter has made substantial changes to their API offering, the Tweetalyze suite is essentially defunct.</p>
          <img src="img/dashboard2.png" style="max-width: 100%;"><br><br>
          <p><a href="https://tweetalyze.com/tweetle/"><b>Tweetle</b></a> - The final addition to the Tweetalyze suite, Tweetle is a Wordle-inspired, Twitter-themed guess-the-number game.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://tweetalyze.com/dashboard/"><b>Tweetalyze Dashboard</b></a> - The third iteration of a long-term passion project, this tool allows users to query tweet data from Twitter to build and visualize their own pre-cleaned data sets.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://tweetalyze.com/chart/"><b>Tweetalyze Chart Builder</b></a> - In scenarios where the pre-fabricated charts on Dashboard are not appropriate, Chart Builder enables approachable, visual analysis of tweet samples. You can pivot on several parameters and add insights like bell curves and regressive trend lines.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://tweetalyze.com/quicktrend/"><b>Tweetalyze Quick Trend</b></a> - In recognition that some users may not need Dashboard's full feature suite, this page is a faster way to visualize and drill-down on Like and Retweet stats. Following this same philosophy, I also created an simple page to <a href="https://tweetalyze.com/sentiment/"><b>analyze and trend tweet sentiment</b></a>.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://tweetalyze.com/search/"><b>Tweetalyze Search</b></a> - Unlike the numerically-focused tools in the Tweetalyze family, Search provides a simple interface for users to perform a fuzzy search on recent tweet text and displays results in order of relevance. Search was intended to be a more practical successor to <a href="https://tweetalyze.com/askauser/"><b>Ask a User</b></a>, a crude implementation of BERT NLP using Google's TensorFlow library. For users who are less familiar with Twitter, <a href="https://tweetalyze.com/newsboard/"><b>Newsboard</b></a> provides a pre-curated sample of tweets and topics from major media outlets to search.
          </p>
          <p><a href="https://tweetalyze.com/markov/"><b>Tweetalyze Fake Tweet Generator</b></a> - As a Computer Engineer, I never had the chance to learn about Markov chains like my Computer Science friends. To address this gap, I leveraged my existing Twitter API server and practiced implementing a probablistic Markov model. After some minor revisions, I created the <a href="https://tweetalyze.com/markov-multiple/"><b>Tweetalyze Bot</b></a>: a comical demonstration of model training that allows users to add multiple learning sources.
